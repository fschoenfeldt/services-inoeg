# Data

# distances.csv.gz

Contains a CSV-separated list of the distances for zip code areas in Germany (only for zip code areas whose geographical centers are less than 50 km apart). The list only contains the "upper" half of the distance matrix, a full mapping can be easily constructed from this though. Format:

[zip code A],[zip code B],[distance in km]

The data for the zip codes areas was extracted from OpenStreetMap (Â© OpenStreetMap contributors). The OSM data is available under the OpenStreetMap license, please look at [the OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) for more information.
